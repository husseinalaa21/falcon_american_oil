			<h2>Our Specialty</h2>
			<p>FAO specializes in the management of oil and gas exploration. From initial data collection to analysis through production, FAO utilizes the most advanced technology available to increase efficiency while minimizing environmental impact. The technologies available currently include passive seismic spectroscopy, 2D/3D seismic, aeromagnetic, gravity, and geochemical analysis; combined, they reduce risk and minimize cost (dollar per barrel) to all involved parties. We at FAO understand the risks and rewards in all aspects of oil and gas exploration and production. We work hard to ensure that all data is transmitted to your decision-making team in simple, easy-to-understand terms to help ensure a positive investment experience. Explore more about our services.</p>
			<h2>Falcon American Oil (FAO)</h2>
			<p>Falcon American Oil (FAO) operates throughout the USA from a Michigan-based headquarters. We handle multiple aspects of oil and gas exploration, as well as the production of both. There have been more than 56,000 oil and gas wells drilled, producing more than 1 billion barrels of oil in Michigan; experts believe this may be less than half of the reserves remaining.</p>
